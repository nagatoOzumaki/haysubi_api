        Charging time to long .50% charging time 1 hour 35 minutes.
        Ovarall the price segment this mobile good`,

        It has the potential to be a nice casual daily driver
        Speakers are loud...like seriously loud.
        Screen size is good
        Though being a LCD screen it produces decent colours. For the price at which it comes that more than enough.
        Camera is neither the best nor the worst, it's quite good for this price point.
        6000 mA battery üîãüëçüèª
        Though it comes with a lot of bloatware but you can just uninstall most of them (excluding system apps)
        Finally the Verdict is that it's a good budget smartphone`,

      'Old concept... realme 7 pro has same 720 g processor .yes 720g is very capable but using it again and again is not good but yes camera is very good even in 20x zoom images are super good and one thing more narzo 30 pro has 5g connectivity but this hadnt so ya 5g should be there',
      'Not a worth buy considering the competetions. A 90hz refresh rate and 732g processor would have given a better competetion and decent buy!!',
      "Super Mobile. I like so much. RAM is good. Camera is amazing. Battery charging speed excellent. Within 45min it will be full from 10% of battery. Only thing, the battery came down little fastly. It's not coming one day with Internet. With internet it's coming around 12 to 15 hrs. Totally very super mobile.",

      `One of the best smartphones of 2020 with reasonable price
      Works smooth as butter
      Camera is undoubtedly the best in prices segment or say any smartphone camera.
      Haptics are awesome
      Battery may need sometime to give you a full day of use as adaptive battery software takes time to learn the way you use the apps and phone
      Size and built quality are gonna impress you when you see it.
      Charging speed is quite fast.
      Overall the best android experience you can ever imagine.`,

        Pros:
        1. Very ultra premium features at this price range of 30k and pretty much matching features with higer range one plus models.
        2. The display is just great.
        3. Screen refresh rate you can actually feel to be fast @90Hz.
        4. No heating issue in phone or the charger till now.
        5. They are giving a back cover with the phone, which is pretty good actually with bumps in side and camera portion which actually saved my phone from a direct fall on a rough floor that too on screen side..and no scratches at all!!..so the cover's tested guysüòÇand it actually feels elegant. ,
        "First I would like to thank you Flipkart for fastest delivery and yah the delivery guy is so cooperative and helpful. Samsung phones are always best in performance and this one is also affordable and awesome phone",
         Cons:
        1. They could have provided a little higher battery capacity like those in Samsung phones coz of Such a high resolution display and refresh rate..but it could have increased the weight of phone..so its pretty much understandable.
        Battery back up is some what 12-14 hrs which I got on continuous usage..like songs.. attending meetings on teams.. Netflix etc. But since it gives so..so..so.. fast charging u just wont feel it.
  
        2. No earphone jack..If that is a con to u..not for me actuallyüòÇ
        Nothing else serious issue this phone has got me into till now .So that it guys..If i find anything else after prolonged Usage I will honestly put it here.
        So I will say if you wanna buy a phone above 50k just dont..buy this if you budget is ~25k stretch it a lill and buy this Nord 2.

      `
        Pros:
       - Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
  - Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
  - Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
  - 6000 Mah battery is BIG
  - 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
  - Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
  - Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.
  - Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.
  - Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.
  - Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good
  - Received next day by 11 AM !
  Cons:
   Not that thin, but ok.
  - Doesn't have Samsung Dex
  - Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.
  - Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)
  - Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.
  
  Feedback
  
  - Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.
  - Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now. (Aug 2021 - excellent, no
